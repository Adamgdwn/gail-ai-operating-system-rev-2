## Current Plan

For ordinary scoped work, agents should start with the lean startup checklist below. Read this file and follow the active plan named here for material work, unclear scope, handoffs, or changes that affect the active plan. Keep it short, current, and pointed at the active build path.

Current priorities:

- keep this repo as the clean Rev 2 workspace for GAIL AI Operating System work
- keep DirectLink as transport/status only, not the Rev 2 project home
- preserve the existing UAOS repo as superseded v1/reference material until migration is explicit
- keep the Linux master environment archive and shared parent-level working copy outside this repo; do not treat either as Rev 2 configuration or live connector approval
- use `gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2` as the canonical technical slug
- confirm copied references in `docs/migration/source-inventory.md` before code migration
- use the private GitHub repository `Adamgdwn/gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2` as the canonical remote after the initial scaffold push
- treat Microsoft 365, QuickBooks, finance, billing, and third-party systems as link-only/planning-only until approved connector boundaries exist
- apply `docs/policy/durable-development-engineering-policy.md` during implementation
- apply `docs/standards/ship-ready-engineering-standard.md` before declaring meaningful work complete
- use `docs/context-map.md` as the short routing map for task-specific context loads
- use `docs/source-of-truth-map.md` when deciding what is active Rev 2 source versus copied reference material
- keep startup lean: use short repo orientation first, then trigger governance, Graphify, plugins, MCP tools, and release checks by task risk or scope
- use Graphify before broad source exploration or architecture analysis, using workspace routing plus repo-local semantic graphs for heavy active repos
- fill in project commands in `AI_BOOTSTRAP.md`
- keep work in context-window-friendly chunks
- timestamp material work, decisions, validation, and handoffs

## Current Build Pathway

Default live build route: [docs/current-build-pathway.md](docs/current-build-pathway.md).

If this project later promotes a different active plan, name it here and route
agents there instead of rereading archived pathway history.

For ordinary scoped work:

1. Run `git status --short`.
2. Read the repo-local agent instructions.
3. Use `docs/context-map.md` when context routing is unclear.
4. Inspect the specific files, errors, or docs needed for the task.
5. Run targeted validation after the change.

For material or risk-triggering changes:

1. Run `bash scripts/governance-preflight.sh`.
2. Review `docs/standards/README.md`.
3. Review `docs/standards/engineering-governance-by-use-case.md`.
4. Review `docs/policy/durable-development-engineering-policy.md`.
5. Review `docs/standards/ship-ready-engineering-standard.md`.
6. Review `project-control.yaml`.
7. Check `exceptions` in `project-control.yaml` and any exception records.
8. For broad source exploration, architecture analysis, dependency tracing, or cross-repo planning, use the Graphify policy at `/home/adamgoodwin/code/Tools/graphify/docs/agent-governance.md` before reading raw source broadly. Reference `/home/adamgoodwin/code/Tools/graphify/workspace/out/graph.json` for cross-repo routing, set up repo-local Graphify when a new repo becomes active, run `/graphify /path/to/repo` from Claude Code for full semantic repo graphs on heavy active repos, and update the relevant graph after code changes.
9. Capture the work timestamp with `date -Iseconds`.
10. Work in the smallest complete chunk that can be reviewed safely.

Risk-triggering work includes production, deployment, authentication, authorization, payments, secrets, sensitive data, database migrations, customer communications, external side effects, infrastructure or provider settings, destructive actions, autonomous tool use, risk classification, governance policy changes, or release readiness.

Rev 2 stop triggers also include live Microsoft 365 content reads, Outlook or
Teams sends, Entra/admin/permission changes, QuickBooks or accounting reads,
invoice/payment/billing actions, vendor account changes, and client-data access.

## Agent Handoff

Update this file only when the top-level plan or handoff point changes. Put detailed step-by-step progress in the active plan named above.

After compaction or a context clear, restart from the latest handoff/work packet,
then run `git status --short`, read the short repo-local instructions, and open
only the active plan and files needed for the next objective. Use
`docs/source-of-truth-map.md` when the next objective needs source routing,
device-role context, or migration boundary context.
